### Features:
1. Basic commands
2. Wildcards
3. Redirections
4. Pipes
5. Background jobs
6. Seperate commands with ';'
7. Signal handling

### Motivation:
I did this mostly for the sake of learning and fun! I always wanted to have my own small shell that I can run everywhere and I can add custom features to.
I am aiming to implement some other features in this later like aliasing, enviromental variables and some basic if/else logics :). This project can also be seen as learning resource for people who want to learn how to make their own shell(I might write an article on this topic).
